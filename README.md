# Arduino_Mega_2560_GPS
The project involves using an Arduino Mega 2560 microcontroller in combination with a Digilent Pmod GPS module to receive and process GPS data. The code provided interfaces with 
the GPS module, extracts relevant information from NMEA sentences, and outputs this data for further use. Here's a summary of the key components and functionalities of the project:

**Components:**
1. Arduino Mega 2560: A microcontroller used as the main control unit.
2. Digilent Pmod GPS: A GPS module that communicates with the Arduino to provide GPS data.

**Functionality:**
1. Serial Communication: The Arduino is configured to communicate with both the GPS module (Serial1) and an external device (Serial) using different baud rates.

2. Data Reception: The Arduino receives NMEA sentences from the GPS module through Serial1. These sentences contain information such as latitude, longitude, time, and indicators.

3. Data Processing: The code parses the received NMEA sentences to extract specific data fields, including the message header, time, latitude, N/S indicator, longitude, and E/W
   indicator.

5. Data Filtering: The code filters and processes NMEA sentences with the header "$GPGGA," which typically contains essential GPS fix information.

6. Data Display: The extracted GPS data is displayed on the Serial Monitor for debugging and monitoring purposes. This includes the header, time, latitude, N/S indicator,
   longitude, and E/W indicator.

**Applications:**
The project can be applied to various applications, including GPS navigation systems, asset tracking, geocaching, weather stations, sports and fitness devices, environmental 
monitoring, remote sensing, and smart agriculture. It serves as a foundation for GPS-based projects, offering the ability to collect and process location-related data.

**Note:** The code provided has been optimized for readability and understanding through the addition of comments. However, it's important to customize and expand the code to
meet the specific requirements of your project, such as data storage, remote communication, or integration with other sensors.
